Prismarine
===================

__Feature-rich server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition & Windows 10 Edition Beta__

Introduction
-------------
Prismarine is a fork of **[Genisys](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys)** and most of the original code was written by **PocketMine Team** and **iTX Technologies**.<br>
Some of the extended functionality that Prismarine offers:

* Synapse Client support
* Optional Xbox Live authentication
* Support for Windows 10 Edition Beta
* TODO: Support for Minecraft PC

However, Prismarine still has a long way to go. We welcome contributions.
